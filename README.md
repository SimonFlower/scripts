These are some example scripts for Autoplot.  Scripts are python code that drive Autoplot programmatically.
For example, a script can make plots of all the data files in a directory, or it can add a digitizer that will record 
mouse click positions.  

Note any script can do damage to your machine.  Please have a look at any script to see that it appears to do reasonable
things.  There's a restricted list of people we trust who can post to this site, but we cannot be responsible for any
damage caused.
